	"description": "Animated pixel art of \"Bad Apple!!\", a famous music video for a 2007 cover of a 4th Touhou Project game sound track. The music video exploded in popularity for its smooth-flowing silhouette animation and its ability to be animated in anything with only black and white colours. The \"Bad Apple!!\" artwork changed frames every 39 seconds with the goal of recreating the music video on a timelapse, a goal in which it succeeded. Afterwards the artwork briefly sent a \"Botting is Cringe\" message to 1337 Coding School, that tried to copy the manually work of the Touhou community using automation, after which it was replaced with the originally planned 東方 end card.",
