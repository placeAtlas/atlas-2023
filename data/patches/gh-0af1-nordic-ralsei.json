	"description": "A version of Ralsei from Toby Fox's Deltarune that was drawn on the Danish flag while the Danes were asleep. Operation Grasslight was enacted in hopes of preserving him, but thanks to many members of the Nordic discord taking a liking to him, he was allowed to live even after the plan failed. Ultimately, however, he was erased by members of the Danish subreddit; a dark day in History.",
