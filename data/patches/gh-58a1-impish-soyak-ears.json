	"description": "Impish Soyak Ears is a soyjak variant based on an edit of Guinness World Record Soyjak. He has a shrunken head, a large mouth, a defined jawline, various other discrepancies that distinguish him as his own variant. Impish Soyak Ears dropped to chaotic reception from the soyteens, and it remains disputed whether it's a win or a fail.\n\nIt was created by the users of the imageboard soyjak.party, the so called \"soyteens\", which is an imageboard revolved about the creation, and discussion of soyjaks. They decided to draw the imp. It didn't hold on to the onslaught of the bad apple. But it did manage to appear on the first day timelapse video of the canvas. So it's seen as a victory by the soyteens.",
